A cave is represented as a three dimensional space in which certain points have paths that lead to other nodes. The script takes an input.txt that describes various attributes of the cave and returns a path using either breadth first search, uniform cost search, or A-star search.

There are a total of 18 directions that the algorithm can go throughout the search as seen above.

This is an example of a path from start to finish.
